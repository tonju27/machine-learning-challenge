# machine-learning-challenge
Over a period of nine years in deep space, the NASA Kepler space telescope has been out on a planet-hunting mission to discover hidden planets outside of our solar system.

To help process this data, i created 3 machine learning models capable of classifying candidate exoplanets from the raw dataset.

Performance of each model

1. RandomForest 

best_score_ = 0.88346353124386

2. SVM model

best_score_ = 0.8815571354761715

3. Logistic Regression

best_score_ = 0.8809844344668495


RandomForest had the best score of predicting new exoplanets. Scores can be improved by increasing number of iterations.
